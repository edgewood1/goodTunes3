# goodTunes3
refactor to include redux

Issues: 

1. logout functionality
2. save works - but itâ€™s not really saving to the database
3. also, should user select whether to save scrape tunes to general database?  
4. click delete functionality
5. scrape works - but it loops 4527 times!
6. fix the seperate rating button
7. clean reducers
